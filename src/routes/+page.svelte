<h1>amber's abode</h1>
<p>Personal. Fun. Wacky. that's what the internet is all about. but honestly, it kinda just feels like a chore a lot of the time. i don't want that. ghis domain isn't going to be a chore, i want to enjoy working on it. i want it to be a reflection of me, what i can do and who i am.</p>
<p>ANYWAY! welcome to my abode!!!</p>
<h2>who am i?</h2>
<p>oh, i never introduced myself! i'm sorry, that was rude of me. i'm amber and i'm a 17 y/o girl living in leicester, england. occasionally i make web pages (like this one), but i prefer to make apps for chat platforms like slack and discord, random python scripts, backends or desktop apps with tauri</p>
